# TDMA and TDM–PCM Communication System Simulation (Python)

## Overview
This project contains Python-based simulations of two different but related communication concepts:

1. **TDMA (Time Division Multiple Access)** – simulated at the network / packet level.
2. **TDM with PCM (Time Division Multiplexing with Pulse Code Modulation)** – simulated at the signal level.

The objective of this project is to clearly demonstrate the difference between **how multiple users share a channel (TDMA)** and **how multiple signals are digitally encoded and multiplexed (TDM + PCM)**.

## TDMA Simulation

### Description
This part of the project simulates **Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)** for a multi-node network.  
Each node is assigned a fixed time slot within a TDMA frame. The simulation includes realistic effects such as **guard time** and **synchronization jitter**, which can lead to packet collisions if timing constraints are violated.

This is a **packet-based simulation**, not a waveform-level modulation model.

### Key Concepts Implemented
- TDMA frame structure
- Slot allocation per node
- Guard time between slots
- Synchronization jitter
- Collision detection
- Packet transmission success/failure

### Performance Metrics
- Packet Delivery Ratio (PDR) per node
- Network Throughput (packets per frame)
- Average Latency

## TDM with PCM –Simulation

### Description
This part of the project implements **Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)** combined with **Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)** to digitally transmit multiple analog signals over a single channel.

Three analog signals (sine, cosine, and sawtooth) are processed through the complete digital communication chain.

### Processing Stages
1. Analog signal generation
2. Sampling at 8 kHz
3. Uniform quantization (8-bit)
4. PCM encoding
5. TDM frame formation (24 bits per frame)
6. NRZ line coding
7. Demultiplexing
8. PCM decoding
9. Signal reconstruction
10. Mean Square Error (MSE) analysis

### System Parameters
- Sampling frequency: 8 kHz  
- Quantization: 8-bit uniform quantizer  
- Number of channels: 3  
- Bits per TDM frame: 24  
- Line coding: NRZ
